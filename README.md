Contact: 

MiniRHex is a miniature scale hexapod designed by the [Robomechanics Lab](https://www.cmu.edu/me/robomechanicslab/) based on the design of RHex. Notable features include a laser-cut frame and 3D printed legs for low cost construction and an intuitive software package that allows for highly-customizable control over the robotâ€™s behavior. MiniRHex is designed to be an educational and outreach tool to allow students to experiment with a fully functional walking robot at a much lower cost. The low price tag lets research groups maintain a fleet of machines, allowing each student more hands-on interaction with the hardware. Possible educational principles include gait design and optimization, leg design and control, and mobile robot sensor incorporation.

# Operating Instructions
1. Connect the MiniRHex to your computer via the Micro USB port
2. Open MiniRHex.ino in the OpenCM IDE and check that under "Tools":
   - "Board" is set to XX
   - "Port" is set to the correct COM port (whichever COM port is added when MiniRHex is plugged in)
3. XXXEnsure the motor zeros in leg_info.cpp are correct
4. Set desired gait parameters in gait_parameters.cpp
5. Click the download icon in the upper left corner of the OpenCM IDE (wait until it reports "Done Downloading")
6. Disconnect the Micro USB cable and connect the battery
7. 
8.
9. 
10. Press the "RESET" button again to return to the standing behavior
